# stock-price-prediction
The project provides suggestions for enhancing a stock price prediction app created using Python and several libraries like Streamlit, yfinance, and Plotly. Here's a breakdown of the suggestions:

1. Model Evaluation: After making predictions, the app should calculate metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess the accuracy of the predictions.

2. Parameter Optimization: Instead of manual parameter selection, automated methods like Grid Search or Auto ARIMA could be implemented to find the optimal values for model parameters (`p`, `d`, `q`) and improve prediction accuracy.

3. Interactive Visualization: Enhance visualization by adding interactivity such as hover-over data points for specific values, dynamic zoom functionality, and adjustable time ranges to provide users with a more engaging and informative experience.

4. Error Analysis: Display confidence intervals or prediction intervals alongside predictions to convey the uncertainty associated with forecasts, enabling users to understand the range within which actual values are likely to fall.

5. Feature Engineering: Explore adding additional features like technical indicators, sentiment analysis of news articles, or macroeconomic indicators to improve the model's performance and predictive capabilities.

6. Deployment: If planning to deploy the app for wider use, consider hosting it on a platform like Heroku or deploying it as a web service using AWS or Azure for accessibility and scalability.

These suggestions aim to make the app more user-friendly, insightful, and robust for predicting stock prices, providing users with a comprehensive tool for analysis and decision-making in the financial domain.
